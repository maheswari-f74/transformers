# transformers
This repository contains implementations and experiments related to Transformer models, which are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and other machine learning tasks.

Overview
Transformers are deep learning models designed to handle sequential data, using self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual relationships efficiently. This project aims to provide code for building, training, and experimenting with Transformer architectures.

Features
Implementation of Transformer encoder and decoder

Training on sample datasets

Attention visualization

Support for customizing model parameters

Examples of usage with text data

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

PyTorch (or TensorFlow, update as per your repo)

NumPy

[Other libraries you use]

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/maheswari-f74/transformers.git
cd transformers

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)

Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the main script or notebook to train or test the Transformer model. Example:

python train_transformer.py --data_path path/to/data --epochs 10 --batch_size 32

Adjust the parameters as needed.
